System conceived by Tiago Forte

#Projects

* short term collection of tasks and notes.
* Those tasks should have a deadline. 
* Collecting information in the folder

#Areas
* Something you're responsible for over longer period of time
* Ongoing engagement and responsibility.
* Example: House
	* Responsible for maintenance
	* Making sure the roof doesn't leek
	* Regular painting.
* Health
* Knowledge in certain area.
	
#Resources
* Collections of information which you expect to be useful in future.
* Reference, things you expect to comeback too (to store).

#Archive
* Notes which are not useful currently or near future, but which you do not want to throw away either. Some topic that we have concluded and done with.
* Basically archives are projects that you have finished.
